This project was tricky, I came across many issues and did a **great** deal of reading and experimentation in order to resolve these issues (with varying levels of success). 

### Some things I've learned over the course of this project:

- One of the most important things I learned is that the devil is in the details; large periods of time were essentially wasted as I searched for solutions to a problem that was caused by a missing comma, for example.

- Creativity is very important, but sometimes the most obvious method is the best (but sometimes it isn't)

### Standing Issue
Unfortunately the console display does not look exactly as it should, missing some spaces and including unwanted brackets.

Despite these unwelcome additions, however, the maths being performed is sound.
